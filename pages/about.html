    <p> Today with 22 y.o., and located in Pernambuco, Brazil, I started the career with 17 years old in a local company called C.E.S.A.R as an apprentice. Became a part-time developer with a few months, and after almost 4 years I was part of different kinds of projects, from embedded systems to web applications. I used many different languages and technologies, like JavaScript, Java, C#, Lua, AngularJS, Bootstrap, and some others. So, even with few years, the process of learn something new is already common to me.</p>

    <p>Also at 17, I started a Computer Science undergraduation, and along 3 years I completed courses like Algorithms, Software Engineering and Databases, but then, at the end of 2016 I was not satisfied with my overall performance, and then quit the Universitie. Few months later I became self-taught student and started again studing CS subjects.</p>

    <p>I like to learn new things and improve myself, and I think that the learning process must be an enjoyable experience, doesn't matter if it is learn a new programming language or play a Chopin Nocturne. Good challenges are welcome. =) </p>

    <p>I basically have interest in almost everything that involves programming, interactive applications (games, web apps), music theory or math. Or a mix of them.</p> 

    <p>You can see some of personal projects (or experiments) in the programming page.</p>

        That's it. Thanks =) </br>
